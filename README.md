## Data for https://github.com/constructicon/russian


### Generation of YAML files

First the Google spreadsheet is saved as Excel sheet.
Then the Excel sheet is opened and saved in CSV format.

Then, YAML files are auto-generated from `database.csv` using:
```bash
$Â rm -f data/*yml  # this is to make sure that deleted records get removed also in this repository
$Â python convert-db.py database.csv
```


### Combined data file

The individual YAML files are combined into one data on the
["generated"](https://github.com/constructicon/russian-data/tree/generated)
branch.

This is done automatically upon each push or pull request towards the `main`
branch using [this workflow](.github/workflows/combine.yml):

```console
$ python combine.py data > data-combined.yml
```
