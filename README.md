### Auto-generation of YAML files

YAML files are auto-generated from `database-2020-12-26.csv` using:
```
$Â python convert-db.py database-2020-12-26.csv
```


### Combined data file

The individual YAML files are combined into one data on the
["generated"](https://github.com/constructicon/russian-data/tree/generated)
branch.

This is done automatically upon each push or pull request towards the `master`
branch.
